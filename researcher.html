			<h1>Pigeon Island</h1>
			<br />
				<p>Pigeon Island was home to the Arawaks and Carib around 1000 A.D. In 16th century
				a french pirate named Francois le Clerc used the island as his base.
				The island is a historic site for 18th-century British fort and Fort Rodney. They were
				both used by the British to spy on French Ships.
				In the 1700s Admiral Rodney took over the Pigeon Island and made it his base.
