			<h2>Adventurer's Story</h2>
			<br />
				<h3>Be the Carib</h3>
				<p>Your adventure takes you through many hidden places on the island. But you must try to find the <br />
				 treasure before the treasure the pirates stole from you before they were killed by the soldiers. <br />
				 Try your best to avoid Chief solo and his wife because you will be in alot of trouble.
				 <br />
				 <br />
				
				<h3>Be the Soldier</h3>
				<p>Your adventure takes you through many places. I hope you don't run into Chief Solo. He will punish you <br />
				by sending you to the poison ivy trap and the mongoose pen. Hope you get to discover the treasure.</p>
				<br />
				
				<p>Be very careful because the wrong click can take you right back home without your treasure.</p>
